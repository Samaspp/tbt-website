                Our mission is to build a sustainable and accessible environment

                Literary clubs are functioning successfully in various
                institutions around the world. Hence, being one of the best
                engineering colleges in the country, MEC also needed a
                well-established literary club.

                Numerous students are interested in reading, sharing their
                insights and improving their literary skills. Furthermore, it is
                essential to inculcate the habit of reading in all students.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's how The Book Thieves originated in MEC. With the help of
                Lakshmi Sreekumar, a former student, the first core team of TBT
                formed a space not just for people who enjoy literature or
                fiction, but instead for all people of unique and varying
                interests.{" "}
